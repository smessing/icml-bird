# Model One: Structured SVM.


## [IN PROGRESS] get all data into SVM file format, one large train file.
  * D x N for training example: 16 x 7734 - with this number of features, will
    probably need to implement some sort of PCA / PCA Whitening. Might also
    want to explore using MVE if PCA gives poor results...

## [TODO] get test data into SVM file format, separate files for separate
   runs

## [TODO] train model

## [TODO] test model
